**This is my second attempt at Code Refactoring. The code was given to me through my Coding Class**

This is a landing page for my first ever refactored code!
My Coding Class I was in gave me some started code to go in and fix up, and make appealing in a more semantic matter!

There is a screenshot of the layout provided above! Feel free to take a look at its layout!

This file was created by me, Kyle Todoran!

Let me know if something isn't quite working or you think something else needs fixed! Just shoot me an email at ktodoran@gmail.com! I would love the feedback!

# Module 1 Challenge

This is my first attempt at Code Refactoring.

I was given a starter code file, and was told to refactor the code so that it looked cleaner and all of the functions worked.

It is a landing page for a Marketing Agency, that wanted their codebase to follow accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines!

This code was refactored by me, Kyle Todoran!
